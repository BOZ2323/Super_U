# Super_U
Chat the night away! Super_U is a  small social-network, where users can edit their profile, send and accept friend requests, visit friend`s profiles, write wall posts, see users who are currently online and chat with them. I used react.js, redux, socket.io, node.js, express,js and postgreSQL to build this project.
